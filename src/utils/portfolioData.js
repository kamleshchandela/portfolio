## Kamlesh Chandela
- **Roles**: Full Stack Developer, UI/UX Designer, Creative Thinker, Code Artisan.
- **Tagline**: Crafting immersive digital experiences with modern web technologies.
- **Location**: (Based on experience: Gujarat/India context implied, but specific location in Experience is US-based for the examples provided in the code - wait, the code has "Google - Mountain View", "Apple - Cupertino". I should clarify if these are real or placeholders. The user provided "Taj Hotel Clone", "Cars24 Clone" etc. implying a student/learner profile. I will present the information AS IS from the code, but be aware it might be placeholder text. Actually, looking at the 'Certificates', they are "Job Simulators" from JPMorgan, Walmart. This suggests Kamlesh is an aspiring developer building a portfolio. I will treat the "Google/Apple/Meta" experience in the code as *what is currently on the site*, but it looks like placeholder data. 
*Constraint checking*: The user's prompt said "Contact part me mera no...". The 'Experience' file had Google/Apple/Meta. I will assume for the AI context that I should strictly use what is in the files, but maybe add a disclaimer or just be literal. 
Actually, I should check if the user *wants* me to keep that dummy data. The user seems to be building a portfolio. I will use the data *currently in the files*.
